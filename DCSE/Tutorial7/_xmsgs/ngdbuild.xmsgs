<msg type="info" file="NgdBuild" num="738" delta="unknown" >A case sensitive search for the INST, PAD, or NET element referred to by a constraint entry in &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">constraints.ucf</arg>&apos; that accompanies this design has failed, while a case insensitive search is in progress. The result of the case insensitive search will be used, but messages will accompany each and every use of a case insensitive result. Constraints are case sensitive with respect to user-specified identifiers, which includes names of logic elements in a design.
